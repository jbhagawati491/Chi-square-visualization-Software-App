🎉 Welcome to the Chi-Square Visualizer App!

This application was built using MATLAB and requires the **MATLAB Runtime** to run. The Runtime is a free official component from MathWorks that allows you to run MATLAB-based apps without needing MATLAB installed.

🟢 You only need to install the MATLAB Runtime once.
